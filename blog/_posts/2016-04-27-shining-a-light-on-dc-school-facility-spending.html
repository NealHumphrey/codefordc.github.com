<p>In the late 1990s, DC public schools were on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1997/02/18/in-lieu-of-planning-patchwork/458079f3-0aab-49ef-a013-30b6d2e92e2f/">brink of collapse</a>. Thousands of fire code violations led to temporary closings. A GAO report found over 70% of DC public schools had inadequate features, such as windows and heating. All had asbestos, many lead paint.</p>

<p>Since then the District has spent billions of dollars restoring and modernizing its schools, some to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.perkinseastman.com/project_3405944_dunbar_high_school">award-winning levels.</a> But much of that investment has been opaque. Last year the DC Auditor found the school modernization program <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/looselips/2015/07/09/audited-school-modernization-program-rigged-against-accountability/">lacks accountability, transparency, and basic financial management.</a></p>

<p>Code for DC in partnership with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.21csf.org/csf-home/">21st Century School Fund</a> has launched <a target="_blank" href="www.forgenerationstocome.org">forgenerationstocome.org</a> to increase transparency on the billions spent on DC school facilities. The website shines a light on previously unseen data, over 20 years of historical and future planned spending on school facilities. We consolidated over 15 different data sources from agencies including Office of Budget and Finance, Office of the State Superintendent of Education, and Office of the Chief Technology Officer, among others. Data visualizations allow users to slice and dice the data to see where money has been spent and how individual schools compare. Maps make clear geographic disparities in school modernization funding while bubble charts show differences across grade level and other factors.</p>

 <p>Recently members of the Code for DC project team and 21st Century School Fund presented the website to DC City Council as part of discussions on future facility spending budget to high praise. We hope it is used to improve transparency, accountability, and equity in school facility spending going forward. Go to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="www.forgenerationstocome.org">forgenerationstocome.org</a> to discover the data for yourself.

<p>The project was made possible through the hard work of Nancy Huvendick and Mary Filardo of 21st Century School Fund along with the following Code for DC volunteers: Tom Beach, Giulia Campanella, Amanda Hess, Tim Lee, Nick Sam, Nick Skelsky, and myself.</p>
